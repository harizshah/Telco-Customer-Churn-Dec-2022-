## Churning Summary
- The risk of a categorical feature tells us if a group that has the feature will have
the condition we model. For churn, values lower than 1.0 indicate low risk of
churning, whereas values higher than 1.0 indicate high risk of churning. It tells
us which features are important for predicting the target variable and helps us
better understand the problem we’re solving.
- Mutual information measures the degree of (in)dependence between a categorical variable and the target. It’s a good way of determining important features: the higher the mutual information is, the more important the feature.
